Let's talk about the time and space complexity for the solution that merges two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2.

Time Complexity:

- The primary loop in the merge function iterates through both arrays simultaneously until either i or j becomes negative.
- In each iteration, we compare elements from nums1 and nums2 and place the larger element at the end of nums1.
- Since we traverse both arrays once, the time complexity is O(m + n), where:
     - m is the length of nums1.
     - n is the length of nums2.


Space Complexity:

- The space complexity refers to the additional memory used by the algorithm.
- In this case, the algorithm modifies nums1 in-place without using any additional data structures.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1) (constant space), as we do not allocate any extra memory proportional to the input sizes.

In summary:

Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
