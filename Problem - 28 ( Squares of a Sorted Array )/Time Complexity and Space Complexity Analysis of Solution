Let's talk about the time and space complexity for the solution.

Time Complexity:
    - The code consists of two main parts:
        1. Squaring all elements in the input array.
        2. Applying the two-pointer technique to sort the array of squared elements.

    - Letâ€™s analyze each part:
        1. Squaring all elements takes linear time, O(n), where N is the size of the input array.
        2. The two-pointer technique also takes linear time, O(n), as it involves iterating through the input array.

    Combining these complexities, the overall time complexity is O(N).

Note: The sorting step is not explicitly performed; instead, the two-pointer technique ensures the sorted order of squared elements.

Space Complexity:

     - The code uses additional memory for the output array (ans) and a few integer variables (i, j, and k).
     - The space required for the output array is O(n) since it has the same size as the input array.
     - The integer variables (i, j, and k) occupy constant space.
  
    Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).

In summary:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
