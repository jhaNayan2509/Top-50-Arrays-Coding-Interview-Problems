Let's talk about the time and space complexity for the solution.


Time Complexity:   O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums vector. 
                   The time complexity arises from traversing the array to find the pivot point, swapping elements, and reversing subarrays.


Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses constant extra space, mainly for storing temporary variables and indices.
